# Observation:

Overall, it is clear that Capomulin outperforms all other treatment options in the screen.

The tumor volume changes was compared over time(across the full 45 days) for treatment with different drugs. We found that only for the drugs 'Capomulin', 'Ramicane' there was a decrease in a tumor volume, whereas all other drugs were correlated with an increase in tumor volume by roughly 40-50%.

Capomulin greatly limited the spread of the tumor compared to other treatment options. By study end, the average mouse on Capomulin had only 1 new metastatic site, as opposed to the average 2-3 found in mice of other treatment options.

Mice on the Capomulin treatment had the highest survival rate of any treatment in the screen. Over 90% of mice treated by Capomulin survived the full duration of the trial.
